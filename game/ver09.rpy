    D "You won't have a romantic relationship with Selina anymore.
       There will only be a friendly relationship. You will forget Veronica as well."

       I'm the man here."

    D "Whatever you decide to do will change your life [player_name]. 
       Lileva has messed with your life way too much already. You can't keep going around being her toy.
       You have to take control of your life. So sacrifices should be made."
    
    A "How is it a sacrifice if I take Selina and Veronica with me? Or if Ella comes here? 
       Isn't that the same thing? I can understand leaving Selina can be considered a sacrifice. 
       Even leaving Ella as well."
    
    A "But what about the other two? And why am I being given such options?"

    scene 113-10 with Dissolve (1.0)

       Think of Rachel. What will she go through if you keep moving from girl to girl?"
    
    A "I..."
    
    D "Yes you are still going to have someone to love other than Rachel. We need that person.
       Rachel won't be able to survive if someone doesn't feed us. But you know that already, don't you?"
    
    D "I'm not asking you to use that person as a tool to get Rachel back. 
       You can love her, marry her and do whatever you want. But Rachel always comes first."

       You can totally focus on Ella and Rachel."

    D "I'm not saying she will definitely win but everything will be very complicated as you'll have to manage  them all at once."
    
    D "Breaking up with Ella will give you the chance to continue your life as it is. 
       You and Selina have been in love for a very long time. Nothing changes between you two. 
       You will be able to focus on saving Rachel then."
    
    scene 113-11 with Dissolve (1.0)

       But you won't have it easy. Your relation with Selina will become complicated. 
       And Lileva will definitely try to take advantage."

       Shouldn't you be just suggesting me to pick either only Ella or Selina?"
